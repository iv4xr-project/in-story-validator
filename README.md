# StoryValidator

The Story Validator takes a JSON file outputted from Twine and, by treating the branching narrative as a directed graph, uses a DFS based algorithm to traverse all possible narrative paths and provide insightful data on different story metrics, and design issues encountered, via visual representations.

## Usage
Inside "Stories" there's two JSON files with story examples to test the tool
